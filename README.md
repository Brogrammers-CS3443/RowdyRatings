Rowdy Ratings - Student ratings and information for all professors at UTSA
## Project Purpose & Goal
Rowdy Ratings is an app that compiles information about professors and courses offered at UTSA in one place for students to access. This will allow UTSA students to search for professors to see what courses they've taught in the past, read reviews of students that have taken their courses as well as write their own, and compare information between professors to help them make the best choices when determining which courses and professors to take in the future.

## How It Works
Rowdy Ratings functions by storing information about professors in csv files that are updated when writing a review for those professors, these files are then dynamically loaded when a user searches for a professor to display this information to the user.
