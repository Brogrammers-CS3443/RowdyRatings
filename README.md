Rowdy Ratings - Student ratings and information for all professors at UTSA
## Project Purpose & Goal
Rowdy Ratings is an app that compiles information about professors and courses offered at UTSA in one place for students to access. This will allow UTSA students to search for professors to see what courses they've taught in the past, read reviews of students that have taken their courses as well as write their own, and compare information between professors to help them make the best choices when determining which courses and professors to take in the future.

## How It Works
Rowdy Ratings functions by storing information about professors in csv files that are updated when writing a review for those professors. These files are then dynamically loaded when a user searches for a professor to display this information to the user.

## Instructions For Running the Application
At the start of the application the user will click search by professor name. The user will then be taken to the screen where they will click the search bar and type the professor name that they are searching for. The user will click the name of the professor where they will be taken to the professor screen and shown a list of reviews tied to that professor. The user can then click the plus button to add a review where they will be taken to the write review page. The user can then fill out the sections required and press the submit review button where their review will be written to a file in the AVD memory.

## Known Issues
Need to work on formatting the view professor review screen. Add review method in the professor class does not correctly add review.
